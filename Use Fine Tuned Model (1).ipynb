      "A fixed deposit (FD) is a type of investment instrument offered by banks and other financial institutions. It is a low-risk investment option where the investor deposits a fixed amount of money for a fixed period, typically ranging from a few months to several years. In exchange for keeping their money locked in the FD, the investor earns a fixed interest rate, which is usually higher than a regular savings account.\n",

      "3. Lock-in Period: Once the money is deposited in an FD, it is locked in for the specified tenure. This means that the investor cannot withdraw the money before the end of the tenure without incurring penalties.\n"
